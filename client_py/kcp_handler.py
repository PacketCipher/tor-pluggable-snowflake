# KCP (reliable UDP) Handler for Snowflake Python Client
#
# The Go Snowflake client uses `xtaci/kcp-go` to provide a reliable session
# over the WebRTC data channels (which themselves are typically reliable via SCTP).
# This is an unusual layering (reliability over reliability) and the reasons
# for this specific choice in Snowflake need to be fully understood to determine
# the best path forward for a Python port.
#
# Possible reasons for KCP usage in original Snowflake:
# 1. Specific congestion control algorithms in KCP that behave better for their use case.
# 2. Lower latency characteristics than standard SCTP implementations in browsers/WebRTC.
# 3. Historical reasons or easier integration with SMUX at the time.
# 4. Fine-grained control over retransmission timers, window sizes, etc.
#
# Porting `xtaci/kcp-go` to Python would be a significant undertaking.
#
# Options:
# 1. Direct Port: Translate the Go KCP logic to Python. Complex and time-consuming.
#    - Consider projects like `pykcp` (if active and compatible) or others.
#    - A quick search shows `pykcp` (e.g., on PyPI) seems to be bindings to the C version of KCP,
#      or very old and unmaintained Python implementations.
#      `kcp-py` on PyPI also looks like a binding or an older implementation.
#
# 2. Alternative Python KCP: Find a well-maintained, pure-Python KCP library that is
#    compatible with `xtaci/kcp-go`'s wire format and behavior. This seems unlikely.
#
# 3. CFFI/Cython Wrapper: Wrap the `xtaci/kcp-go` library (or its underlying C KCP core if applicable)
#    for use in Python. This adds build complexity.
#
# 4. Omit KCP: If WebRTC's default SCTP-based reliability is sufficient for the Python client's
#    goals, KCP could potentially be omitted. This would simplify the client significantly
#    but might deviate from the Go client's performance characteristics or capabilities.
#    This depends heavily on *why* KCP was chosen for the Go client.
#
# 5. Implement a Simpler Reliability Layer: If KCP's full feature set isn't strictly
#    necessary, but some custom reliability or framing is, a simpler protocol could be
#    implemented. (Likely not ideal as it deviates from Snowflake's core).
#
# For now, this module is a placeholder.
